Longest Common Sequence

Longest common subsequence of two strings
Purpose
This programming assignments implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. LCS algorithm is applied to many real-world problems including DNA/protein sequence alignment in bioinformatics, and computational linguistics. You will implement the algorithm using iteration and recursion, analyze and compare the two implementations.
Note: Note: When generating log file of iterative program for part2, you can use repl.it, since the school Linux server is so fast, it takes 0 times most of the cases.
The Longest Common Subsequence problem
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences. Note that it is different from the longest common substring problem, which requires to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The LCS problem here, does not require to have consecutive positions. 
For example,
If the two strings are
AACCTTGG
ACACTGTGA
then the LCS resulting string is 
AACTGG 
and the  LCS length =6
 
Note that the subsequence is not unique, but the longest length is always the same. 
From the above example, 
AACCTTGG
ACACTGTGA
The LCS  resulting string can be 
AACTTG
but the LCS length is  again 6

Statement of Work
Part 1 
Write a program that reads two strings from an input￼
Download input
 file (The first line is X, the second line is Y), compute the longest common subsequence length AND the resulting string. 
You will need to write 2 methods
1) return LCS length in iterative function
// return the length of LCS. C is the 2D matrix, X, Y are the input strings, m=|X|, n=|Y|
int lcs_it(int **C, string X, string Y, int m, int n )
2) return LCS resulting string in recursive function
// return the resulting LCS string. 
string backtrack(int **C, string X, string Y, int m, int n)
Hint:
Compute the length of LCS requires to use 2D matrix where the row is |X|+1, column is |Y|+1. And the 2D matrix result should be used to construct the resulting string.  Below is how to create a 2D array and how to pass it to the lcs_it function.
The methods will be tested in the main method as the following. 
 
===== main ====================
int m=X.size();

int n=Y.size();

int **C=new int*[m+1];
for (int i=0; i<m+1;++i) C[i]=new int [n+1];

int len=lcs_it(C, X, Y, m, n);

cout<<" LCS is "<<backtrack(C, X, Y, m, n)<<endl;
========================================
Part 2
You will write a program that compares iterative LCS and recursive LCS function.
1. Write the following two methods. 
1) return LCS length in iterative function
int lcs_it_test(string X, string Y, int m, int n )
Unlike the function from part 1, you will not reuse the 2D matrix. So, you should not create 2D array in the main. You will use local 2D array in the function.  
2) return LCS length in recursive function
int lcs_re(string X, string Y, int m, int n)
You will implement a method that compute LCS length using recursive method.
Here,  you will not call the backtrack to get the LCS. You just need to get the length of LCS.  
 
2.  your main function should test both versions of programs. ask the user to input a trial number for each program.
Enter trial time for iterative version (less than min(|X|, |Y|))

Enter trial time for recursive version (less than 20)
 
3. If you implemented correctly, iterative version is fast, but recursive version is very slow. Therefore, you should not increase the size more than 20 for recursive version.
For each iteration, you have to increase the string (X, Y) size and compute the LCS length. You should log the execution time as increasing the string size.
Hint: 
#include <ctime>

 int start_s, stop_s;

start_s=clock();

// Execute program

stop_s=clock();

clog << i << "\t" << (stop_s-start_s)/double(CLOCKS_PER_SEC)*1000 << endl;
 
4. Plot the time as increasing the string size from 1 to 800 for iterative version.  Estimate the big-O of your program.
5. Plot the time as increasing the string size from 1 to 20 for recursive version.  Estimate the big-O of your program.
 
Hint: when you run the program, if you run with
./a.out 2>time.log  Then only the size and time is printed to time.log file. You can open it with excel file to plot the graph.
 
What to Turn in
Clearly state in your code comments any other assumptions you have made. Turn in:
(1) driver.cpp 
your driver.cpp should include both Part1 and Part2.  That is, 
	◦	Return LCS length iteratively with the 2D matrix is passed as a parameter
	◦	Result the LCS string recursively
	◦	Return LCS length iteratively without 2D matrix as a parameter
	◦	Return LCS length recursively
	•	your main function should perform Part1 and Part2
(2) a separate report in .doc or .docx that must includes:
(a) The first page should be an output of your Part1. Print the X, and Y, and LCS length and string. (X and Y are provided in the input￼
Download input
 file)
(b) Plots that show the performance of iterative LCS and recursive LCS.  You should have a separate plot for each method.
(c) Estimated Big O for each algorithm.
